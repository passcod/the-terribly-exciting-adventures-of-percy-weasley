<!-- Summer 1981 -->

It was a nice day.

His younger walking brothers were out of the house, his older working brothers
were at school, his tiny sleeping brother was in a crib, and his unborn kicking
sister was in his mother's belly.

<!-- C: 9, W: 10 (at wizard primary), F&G: 3 (on excursion with dad), R: 1 -->

Hence: it was a nice day.

He reflected[^1] that it may very well be one of the last nice days he would
ever experience. He was four and some halves, a sister (“there hasn't been a
girl Weasley in centuries!” he'd heard Auntie Murriel exclaim in that shrill
voice he already knew meant unpleasantness) on the way, brothers that were
starting to talk, and more alarmingly, school would start when he turned five,
which had to be soon, now, surely.

It was therefore to be that Percy Weasley would get out of the house and take
advantage of this nice day to disappear into the tall grass, delighting in how
the stalks and flowers brushed his cheeks, and run around, his arms extended,
yelling nonsense at the top of his voice, falling happily backwards, getting
back up immediately, chasing after butterflies, crouching down to look at bugs.

From the kitchen window, longingly looking at the gleeming pots and pans
(Arthur, in a rare display of decisiveness, had put his foot down and advised
her not to do any cooking for the last month before she was due. He was right,
she really oughtn't, but the steel and spices called), Molly smiled and readied
her wand, for her third boy would surely track in much mud whenever he had
exhausted himself.

  certainly not a beginners' book with large type and pictures, but one he had
  found in the library, with thin lines in pretty patterns and letters that
  didn't _quite_ look the same as he'd been taught.
